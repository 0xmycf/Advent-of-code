# Advent of Code

Isn't it the most wonderful and joyful time of the year?

# 2023

I'll do it in a few different langauges this year, depending on my mood (or if I think I have to do some more studying on R/Java).

| Day | Language | Solution | Reflection |
|-----|----------|----------|------------|
| 1   | Haskell, R (only a) | [Haskell](./2023/haskell/aoc23/src/Days/Day1.hs), [incomplete and messy R](./2023/r/day1.r) | Not a day that favours functional programming |
| 2   | Haskell  | [Haskell](./2023/haskell/aoc23/src/Days/Day2.hs)        | Very nice. Used a semigroup instance and lots of datatypes :handsup: |
| 3   | Haskell  | [Haskell](./2023/haskell/aoc23/src/Days/Day3.hs)        | Very quick and dirty, did not bother too look over it again. The solutions was quite straight forward though. Compared to the previous day 3 problems this seems quite bloated.|
| 4   | Haskell  | [Haskell](./2023/haskell/aoc23/src/Days/Day4.hs)        | This is where Haskell's laziness shines. I was unable to get the tie ([tying the knot](https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot)) and got some inspiration of the internet. My basic idea was correct though and I was really close to the real solution |
| 5   | Gleam    | [Gleam (only a so far)](./2023/gleam/src/aoc23.gleam)        | Trying out gleam, `use` can be quite handy, but also quite confusing.          |

- [Day 3](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day03.hs)  | No Reflection
- [Day 4](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day04.hs)  | No Reflection
- [Day 5](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day05.hs)  | No Reflection (But the parsing took too long lol) (also covid edition :(  )
- [Day 6](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day06.hs)  | No Reflection

- [Day 8](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day08.hs)  | For some reason I did not want to use brainpower on this one, so its not really nice.
- [Day 9](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day09.hs)  | This Day took me too long.. First my snake was too short and then I couldn't figure out where I would need the sgn function... A little bug chocked me almost to death today...
- [Day 10](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day10.hs)  | Tried to use lenses today, went well but the solution is really verbose. (Part B can only be run from ghci)
- [Day 11](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day11.hs)  | Huh, Part a was harder.
- [Day 12](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day12.hs)  | No Reflection
- [Day 13](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day13.hs)  | I think using `sort` was cheating but oh well.
- [Day 14](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day14.hs)  | This one was slow, but is fast now.
- [Day 15](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day15.hs)  | This one was slow and is still slow.
- Day 16 soon?
- Day 17 soon
- [Day 18](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day18.hs)  | Eh, its okay.
- [Day 19](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day19.hs)  | Slow, the GC uses the most time here too. [I watched this video and oriented myself on it (Because I am bad at optimizing things).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rb0vvJ7NCY&t). I might come back in the future and make it faster.
- Day 20 soon
- [Day 21](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day21.hs)  | Part B was trivial in Haskell (tying the knot), I used the guessing game strategy for part b, because I did not want to think about this too hard today.
- Day 22 soon
- Day 23 soon
- Day 25 soon
- [Day 25](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/aoc22/src/Days/Day25.hs)  | Hmpf, one of those days that took me longer than it should have.

## [BQN](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/bqn-22)

- [Day 1](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/bqn-22/day1.bqn) | Great start to learn BQN!

## [Lua](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/lua)

- [Day 1](https://github.com/0xmycf/Advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/lua/day1.lua) | Is this how you do lua?
